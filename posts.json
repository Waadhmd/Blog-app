    "content": "The first step to writing an amazing blog post that you want to read is choosing a compelling topic. This might seem obvious, but deciding on a specific blog niche and zeroing in on topics and angles within that niche can be tricky.\r\n\r\nWhen I started my blog, I made the mistake of trying to cover too many unrelated topics.

I also needed to make it easier to read.",
